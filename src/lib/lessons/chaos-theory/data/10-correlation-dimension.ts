  content: `## Correlation Dimension

The **Grassberger-Procaccia correlation dimension** (D₂) is a fractal dimension that can be estimated directly from a time series, making it invaluable for analyzing real-world chaotic systems.

### The Correlation Sum

Given N points from an attractor, the **correlation sum** C(r) measures the fraction of point pairs within distance r:

\`\`\`
C(r) = (2 / N(N-1)) · #{pairs (i,j) with |xᵢ - xⱼ| < r}
\`\`\`

### The Correlation Dimension

For a fractal set, C(r) scales as a power law:
\`\`\`
C(r) ~ r^D₂
\`\`\`

So:
\`\`\`
D₂ = lim_{r→0} log C(r) / log r
\`\`\`

We estimate D₂ as the slope of log C(r) vs log r.

### Significance

| Attractor Type | D₂ |
|----------------|-----|
| Fixed point | 0 |
| Limit cycle | 1 |
| 2-torus | 2 |
| Lorenz attractor | ≈ 2.06 |
| Hénon attractor | ≈ 1.22 |

A **non-integer D₂** is strong evidence for a strange attractor (chaos).

### Your Task

Implement:
1. \`correlation_sum(points, r)\` — compute C(r) for 1D points
2. \`correlation_dimension(points, r_values)\` — estimate D₂ via linear regression on log-log plot`,
  starterCode: `import math

def correlation_sum(points, r):
    # Count pairs (i,j) with i<j where |points[i]-points[j]| < r
    # Return count / total_pairs (or 0.0 if no pairs)
    pass

def correlation_dimension(points, r_values):
    # Compute correlation_sum for each r in r_values
    # Estimate slope of log(C) vs log(r) using least squares
    # Skip r values where C(r) = 0
    pass`,
